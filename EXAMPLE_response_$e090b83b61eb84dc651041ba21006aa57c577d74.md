### ai-code-reviewer/main-test.py
- The imports in lines 3-6 are not needed and can be removed.
- Consider using `setUpClass` instead of `setUp` since the test client can be reused for multiple test cases.
- The `content_type` parameter in line 27 can be omitted since `json.dumps` already sets the content type to `application/json`.

### ai-code-reviewer/main.py
- The import statement for `OpenAI` in line 8 should be updated to `from openai import OpenAIApi`.
